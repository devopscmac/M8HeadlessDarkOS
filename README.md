# M8HeadlessDarkOS

A custom build of [DarkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos) for the **R36S Plus** handheld gaming device, with the [m8c](https://github.com/laamaa/m8c) M8 Headless client pre-compiled and integrated as a first-class application.

## What is this?

**M8HeadlessDarkOS** = DarkOS (full ARM64 Linux gaming OS) + M8 Headless client

- **DarkOS** is a Debian-based ARM64 Linux distribution optimized for retro gaming on handheld devices using Rockchip SoCs. It includes EmulationStation, RetroArch, and dozens of standalone emulators.
- **m8c** is the official remote display client for the [Dirtywave M8 Tracker](https://dirtywave.com/). It connects to a real M8 hardware unit or a [Teensy 4.1 running M8 Headless firmware](https://github.com/Dirtywave/M8Firmware) via USB, mirrors the M8 display, and routes audio.
- **R36S Plus** is a handheld gaming device with a PK3326 SoC (RK3326-equivalent), 4.0" 720x720 IPS display, and dual analog sticks.

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| Device | R36S Plus |
| SoC | PK3326 (Rockchip RK3326-equivalent) |
| CPU | Quad-core ARM Cortex-A35, 64-bit |
| GPU | Mali-G31 MP2 |
| Display | 4.0" IPS, 720x720 (1:1 square) |
| Storage | MicroSD (8GB minimum, 32GB+ recommended) |
| Connectivity | WiFi, Bluetooth, USB-C, HDMI |

For M8 Headless, you also need:
- A **Dirtywave M8 Tracker** (hardware), OR
- A **Teensy 4.1** running [M8 Headless firmware](https://github.com/Dirtywave/M8Firmware)
- A USB-C to USB-C cable (or USB-C to USB-A adapter)

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the repositories

All three repos must be siblings in the same directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Repos/headless
cd ~/Repos/headless

git clone https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos.git dArkOS
git clone https://github.com/laamaa/m8c.git m8c
git clone <this-repo-url> M8HeadlessDarkOS

cd M8HeadlessDarkOS
```

### Step 2: Install host dependencies

Run once on a fresh machine. This installs the ARM64 cross-compiler, build tools,
and compiles the m8c binary to `bin/m8c-r36splus`:

```bash
bash setup_host.sh
```

What it installs/builds:
- `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`, `cmake`, `ninja-build` — ARM64 cross-compiler toolchain
- `qemu-user-static`, `debootstrap`, `btrfs-progs`, `p7zip-full`, `parted`, `dosfstools` — OS build tools
- **SDL3** — built from source for aarch64 (SDL3 has no reliable arm64 package on Ubuntu)
- **libserialport** — built from source for aarch64
- **m8c** — cross-compiled to `bin/m8c-r36splus` using the above
- `apt-cacher-ng` — package cache to speed up rebuilds

After setup, commit the compiled binary:

```bash
git add bin/m8c-r36splus
git commit -m "Add precompiled m8c ARM64 binary for R36S Plus"
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Verify the environment

```bash
make preflight
```

Checks that dArkOS and m8c repos are found, required scripts exist, and the
directory layout is correct. Does not start any build.

### Step 4: Run the test suite

```bash
make test
```

Validates all build scripts, device configs, EmulationStation configs, and the
m8c binary (if present). All 149 tests should pass before building.

### Step 5: Build the OS image

```bash
# Standard build (recommended)
make r36splus

# Build without apt cache (slower but simpler)
ENABLE_CACHE=n make r36splus

# 64-bit only (faster, skips 32-bit emulator support)
BUILD_ARMHF=n make r36splus
```

The build takes **3–4 hours** with caching enabled (first run ~15–19 hours while
downloading everything). Output: `M8HeadlessDarkOS_r36splus_<MMDDYYYY>.img.7z`

Build progress is logged to `build.log`.

### Step 6: Flash to SD card

```bash
# Find your SD card device
lsblk

# Extract the image (replace date)
7z e M8HeadlessDarkOS_r36splus_*.img.7z

# Flash — replace /dev/sdX with your SD card (double-check this!)
sudo dd if=M8HeadlessDarkOS_r36splus_*.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress conv=fsync
sync
```

> **Warning:** `dd` will overwrite whatever is on `/dev/sdX`. Confirm the device
> with `lsblk` before running.

### Step 7: First boot

1. Insert the SD card into your R36S Plus and power on
2. The first boot expands the filesystem automatically (takes ~60 seconds)
3. EmulationStation will launch into the main menu

### Step 8: Set up M8 Headless on-device

Connect via SSH or open a terminal and run:

```bash
m8c_setup
```

This verifies m8c is installed, checks USB device detection, and confirms audio
and udev rules are working.

See [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md) for advanced build options, cross-compilation details, and troubleshooting.

### Flashing to SD Card

After the build completes:

```bash
# The image will be: M8HeadlessDarkOS_r36splus_<date>.img.7z
# Extract and flash:
7z e M8HeadlessDarkOS_r36splus_*.img.7z
sudo dd if=M8HeadlessDarkOS_r36splus_*.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress
sync
```

Replace `/dev/sdX` with your SD card device (check with `lsblk`).

### Using M8 Headless

1. Boot your R36S Plus with the M8HeadlessDarkOS SD card
2. Connect your M8 or Teensy (M8 Headless) via USB-C
3. From the main menu, press **Select** to open BaRT → choose **M8 Headless**
   — OR —
   Navigate to **Tools → M8 Headless** in EmulationStation

## Build Options

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `DEBIAN_CODE_NAME` | `trixie` | Debian release to use |
| `ENABLE_CACHE` | `y` | Use apt-cacher-ng to speed up rebuilds |
| `BUILD_ARMHF` | `y` | Include 32-bit ARM userspace (some emulators need it) |
| `BUILD_BLUEALSA` | `y` | Include Bluetooth audio support |
| `DARKOS_DIR` | `../dArkOS` | Path to the dArkOS repository |
| `M8C_REPO` | `../m8c` | Path to the m8c source repository |

## Relationship to dArkOS

This project uses dArkOS's build system as its foundation. The `build_r36splus.sh`
script sources most build steps directly from `../dArkOS/` and adds:

1. A new device target (`r36splus`, UNIT=r36splus, CHIPSET=rk3326)
2. The `build_m8c.sh` step that compiles m8c inside the ARM64 chroot
3. R36S Plus device files (720x720 display configs, m8c.ini)
4. M8C integration in EmulationStation (new `m8c` system entry, BaRT menu option)

No modifications are made to the dArkOS repository itself, so it can be updated
independently.

## Running Tests

```bash
make test
# or directly:
bash tests/run_all_tests.sh
```

Tests validate build script syntax, device configurations, ES configs, and
(if present) the precompiled m8c binary.

## Troubleshooting

**m8c can't find the M8 device:**
```bash
# Check for the device
ls -la /dev/ttyACM* /dev/m8 /dev/m8headless 2>/dev/null

# Make sure ark is in dialout group
groups ark | grep dialout
sudo usermod -a -G dialout ark  # then relogin
```

**Audio not working in m8c:**
- Press F12 inside m8c to toggle audio
- Check m8c.ini has `audio_enabled = true`
- The M8 must be in headless mode (display connected before plugging in USB)

**Display is black after launching m8c:**
- Verify `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm` is set in launch_m8c.sh
- Check `/tmp/m8c.log` for errors

**Build fails with "dArkOS not found":**
```bash
# Set the correct path
DARKOS_DIR=/path/to/dArkOS make r36splus
```
